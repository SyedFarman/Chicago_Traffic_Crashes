Project 4 Team 7 - Final Project

In this repository you will find an analysis of Chicago Crash data from the year 2015-2022. As well as multiple different machine learning models that attempt to predict the cost of damages and/or the number of injuries sustained in a crash depending on multiple variables. 

Using different machine learning models, notably the random forest model... we were able to determine that the 3 most important features of the model were: 

'INJURIES_TOTAL' (23%), 

'MOST_SEVERE_INJURY_NONINCAPACTITATING INJURY' (11%), 

'CRASH TYPE INJURY AND / OR TOW DUE TO CRASH' (7%)
