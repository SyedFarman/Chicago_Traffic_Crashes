# Chicago_Traffic_Crashes

## Project Overview
The project involves analyzing crash data in the City of Chicago, which is collected from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at the Chicago Police Department (CPD). The dataset includes information about each traffic crash that occurs on city streets under the jurisdiction of CPD. The records are added to the dataset when a crash report is finalized or amended in E-Crash. The data covers some police districts in 2015, but citywide data is not available until September 2017. The data includes information such as street condition, weather condition, and posted speed limits, recorded by the reporting officer based on the best available information at the time. The project aims to analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to crashes in Chicago, with the goal of providing insights to improve road safety in the city. It is important to note that the dataset only includes reportable crashes, which are those with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring.
