# Chicago Traffic Crashes

## Purpose 

The Chicago Traffic Crashes project involves analyzing electronic crash reports from the Chicago Police Department to identify patterns and factors contributing to traffic crashes in Chicago. The dataset covers some police districts in 2015, but citywide data is available from September 2017. The goal is to provide insights to improve road safety in the city, but the dataset only includes reportable crashes that involve property damage of $1,500 or more, bodily injury, and at least one moving vehicle (except bike dooring).
